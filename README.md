# Lumino

Lumino is an android app. With Lumino you can connect different android devices via Bluetooth. Then the connected devices can play lightscenes with the build-in camera flash simultaneously.

This project is part of the "Mobile Anwendungen" class in the study of computer science at the university for applied sciences in Berlin.
